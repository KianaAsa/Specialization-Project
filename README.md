Automatic fracture analysis from digital elevation models
In this report, the concept of lines and their extraction methods (manual and automatic) are defined
in general and I compared their advantages and disadvantages. One of the features that can help
in the automatic extraction of lines is the magnetic properties of materials. To understand this
issue, different types of magnetic materials have been investigated and 12 Norwegian soil samples
have been measured in the VSM laboratory. The size of the grains in the materials has an effect
on their magnetic properties, which is also reported by presenting hysteresis loop diagrams.
